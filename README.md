## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

Brainstorm Buddy is built with a modern Python stack, prioritizing a reactive user experience and robust backend logic.

  * **Frontend**: The entire user interface is built with **Streamlit**, featuring custom CSS for a polished, modern aesthetic.
  * **Database**:
      * **SQLite** serves as the lightweight, file-based database.
      * **SQLAlchemy** is used as the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for elegant and Pythonic database interactions.
  * **AI Integration**:
      * Powered by **Google's Gemini Pro** large language model.
      * A dedicated `AIClient` class abstracts all API calls, using carefully engineered prompts to ensure reliable JSON and text outputs.
  * **Core Libraries**: The project relies on `bcrypt` for secure password hashing, `PyPDF2` for PDF text extraction, and `python-dotenv` for environment management.
